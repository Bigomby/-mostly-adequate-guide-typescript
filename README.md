# mostly-adequate-guide-typescript

This repo contains the exercises from the popular [Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://www.gitbook.com/book/drboolean/mostly-adequate-guide/details)
adapted to Typescript.

There are unit tests to run against your exercises as you code them. Best way to
do the exercises is with an immediate feedback loop:

```bash
npm run feedback
```

Make sure you have built your project:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can also run test once:

```bash
npm run tests
```

You can find the original exercises on the source repo:
